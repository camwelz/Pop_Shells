Install script for a few of the necessary tools for penetration testing and offensive security on debian based Linux distrobutions

This is intended to be quick and easy way to install most of the neceassary tools to begin pentesting for n00bs like me who would rather use a Linux distro we are more familiar with like Ubuntu or, in my case Pop!_OS, rather than the specific penetration testing distros like Kali or Parrot. There are far less tools here but I plan on adding more over time as I progress along my pentesting journey, and I will do my best to keep this script updated.

A few things to note:

• It is common practice to install these tools on a virtual machine
• I take no credit nor responsibility for any of these applications, how they are used or how they effect your system
• Run with "sudo bash Pop_Shell.sh" (terminal must be open in the same directory as file)
• A new directory "PenTools" will be created in your present working directory (where ever you run this script) for some applications and seclists
